        Electromagnetic Waves

        In order to understand wave-particle duality
        The first technical description of light as a wave came in Christiaan Huygens paper 
        <a href="https://archive.org/details/treatiseonlight031310mbp/mode/2up">Treatise on Light</a> in 1678. 
        He starts with experience, and says that there has not been a sufficient explanation as to 
        why light particles can pass through one another without interfering with eachother. He makes other observations about light,
        and using geometry goes on to describe his wave theory of light. <br>
        The next major development was with Maxwell when he gave light a rigorous mathematical
